/* Example 02 - "Any Combination of Items/Containers makes a layout"
 *
 * This Example demonstrates that ANY layout can be made if correctly defined.
 *
 * ...as a side note: <div>'s CAN be set to scroll... that has nothing to do with this manager..
 *
 * I, the Author, have had bracket/comma/nightmares - this design is not friendly for that.
 * (([{(([[{(try Programming in AutoCAD's AutoLisp), (simple enough just count tons of brackets)}]]))}]))
 *
 * I recomend starting simple: make variables for each piece, so each peice is "easy"
 *
 * var header = h("Header", "100px", 20,
 *                  I("HeaderLeft", "50%"),
 *                  I("HeaderRight", "50%")
 *              );
 *
 * ok... now piece the pieces together....
 *
 *v("ConceptualMasterVerticalColumn___ROOT_OVERALL_SCREEN", 6,
 *     header,
 *     body,
 *     footer
 * );
 * ok... now remove/reduce the varialbes you make until you have the 'above'.
 *
 * in small pieces, this process is "easy"
 *
 * learn from the Authors mistakes - trying to look smart (like above) would have taken me
 * much less time if I broke it down, and looked a little dumber.
 *
 * As a side note: all "conceptual" labels CAN BE REMOVED without error/side effects.
 *
 * the 'reason' one puts it there, is a reference to get it back!
 *
 * if you like it without labels, because you always use variable assignment, go crazy:
 * Note: this only applys if there is no matching element to find.
 * (This applies to H() L() h() v() I()):
 * var header = h("100px", 20,                    // hey, I Can drop the label if no element to match
 *                  I("HeaderLeft", "50%"),
 *                  I("HeaderRight", "50%")
 *              );
