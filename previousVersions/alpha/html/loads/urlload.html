<h2>urlload</h2>

... is a simple routine that looks for attribute "urlload" in a element.<br>
(Hopefully a div) because it will try to:<br>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;div id="doesnTActuallyNeedIdSetAtAll" urlload="somefile.someextension"&gt;
</pre>
Will try to:
<pre class="prettyprint">
document.getElementById("doesnTActuallyNeedIdSetAtAll").innerHTML = ...insert contents of "somefile.someextension" here...
</pre>
This is intended for development purposes to make development of code clear.<br>
At point of production, I strongly recommend pasting them in. (Remove urlload)<br>
...as this will dramatically slow down the load of your page...<br>
<br>...unless of course the content is "pages away" from entry point, then it makes more sense<br>
