/* Example 04 - "Items in a layout can be defined with Dragbars"
 *
 * This demonstrates how to set upper and lower limits for a draggable element(or element groups)
 * by having 3 'start' values, instead of one, it reads them as initial (start) lower (min) and upper (max)
 *
 * Note: v1.0.0 only drags 'px' start values
 * not designed for '%' implementation - draggable change
 *
 * Note: By default, the Dragbar size = margin size.
 * if you are having a difficult time with mouseover, increase margin size.
 * (see Docs for how to custom set)
 *
 * Note: to accomplish this dragbar effect, liefs-layout-manager inserts a child element:
 * <div id="Header">                        // both of these
 *  <div class="Vdragbar"></div>            // are positioned buy liefs-layout-manager
 * </div>                                   // but the .css style of dragbar is all you BABY!
 * <div id="leftSide">                      // :hover effect?
 *  <div class="Hdragbar"></div>            // possible background image?
 * </div>
 *
 * Note: Order of operations has the Item created BEFORE its parent.
 * .....but Dragbar - needs to know the parent Container direction
 * to know which css style to use.... Vdragbar or Hdragbar
 *
 * quick fix - I pushed back its creation by a tick.  Ok - now parent exists
 * at time of creation.  Why do I mention it?
 * You might (like I was) have your code searching for something created Next Tick.
 * ...so your search has to be next tick.
 *
 * Note: you MUST set style.position of (V/H)dragbar to fixed, or is just wont work!
 * You have to do that part (as seen in this example)
