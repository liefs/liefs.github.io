<!-- (~23K) is NOTHING - A VERY IMPORTANT UNDERSTANDING IS HOW SMALL THIS CODE IS! OPEN .min.js in a new page and see -->
<!-- or "https://liefs.github.io/liefs-layout-manager.V1.0.0.js" (~80K) for documented code -->
<!-- Note: liefs-layout-manager starts with the first javascript call to: H/L/h/v/I() - it does nothing "onload"  -->

<!--
/* Example 01 - "You have to start somewhere"
 *
 * sure, for a "one liner" the above is readable, and works fine, but as things progress,
 * readable will be Escential - to avoid "bracket/coma/semicolen nightmares"
 * An easy to spot pattern will help:
 *
 * h("SomeNameImadeUp",
 *  I("leftSide", "400px"),
 *  I("rightSide", "100%")
 * );
 *
 * The above line indicates the following (in order of operations):
 * 1. There is only element in this dom with id="leftSide" - Create (Item Instance) with .label = "leftSide"
 *    The "400px" (refered to as a 'start' value) indicates this element will have
 *    a fixed width/height (...at this point we don't know which) of 400 pixels
 *
 * 2. There is only element in this dom with id="rightSide" - Create (Item Instance) with .label = "rightSide"
 *    The "100%" (refered to as a 'start' value) indicates this element will have
 *    a variable width of "whatever is left after all px's are removed"
 *    In this case, the screen width has 400px removed, and the remaining 100% of pixels go here.
 *
 * 3. h() - is IDENTICAL to I() in EVERY WAY - but is a 'Horizontal Indicator' (see docs)
 *    note: h(...) and I("hor", ...) are IDENTICAL - same function call.
 *
 *    (Because of above Indicator) There may be 0 or 1 elements in the dom with id="SomeNameImadeUp"
 *    In the above example, there isn't an element (0), so outer screen size is used as "root"
 *    If there was an element with id="SomeNameImadeUp" (1), its dimentions would be considered "root"
 *
 *   unlike 1) and 2) this Item Definition has a Horizontal indicator, and Item Children.
 *   That means that "SomeNameImadeUp" is defined as both a (Item Instance) AND a (Container Instance)
 *
 * 4. Wait [Handler.delayUntilStart (default 200)] miliseconds to let the users code "sink in"
 *
 * 5. There is no (Layout Instance) - Create One Automatically - done in background
 *
 * 6. There is no (Handler Instance) - Create One Automatically - done in background
 *
 * 7. Code will remain dormant until a "resizeEvent" - then tries to hold Definitions
 *
